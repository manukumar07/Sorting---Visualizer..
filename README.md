# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! This web application allows you to visualize popular sorting algorithms in action. Watch the algorithms sort an array of numbers and observe how they work step by step.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort,Insertion Sort, selection sort and Quick Sort.
- Adjustable speed control to observe sorting in different timeframes.
- Randomize array feature for quick testing.
- Clear visualization for understanding algorithm steps.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To run the Sorting Visualizer locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd sorting-visualizer`
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

Now you can visualize sorting algorithms and learn how they operate on arrays.
